				<h1>TRANSPORT AND TRANSFERS</h1><h3>GETTING TO AND FROM THE AIRPORT</h3><p>Everyone’s needs are different, so we’ll leave it to you to arrange the best way of reaching the airport for you. Public transport will be reimbursed. Taxi fares will only be reimbursed when the cost per person is the same or less than any other available form of transport.</p><p>When you arrive in Stockholm you’ll be taken to your hotel by a special King bus. Simply find the right bus for your hotel and off you go! And don’t worry, there’ll be some event staff on hand to help out with everything from directions to where you’re staying (if you can’t remember). You’ll be expected to carry your own luggage, though…</p><p>If your flight gets in particularly early or late we might suggest you get a cab to your hotel - if this applies to you we'll let you know separately.</p><h3>A NOTE ON FLIGHTS</h3><p>As the majority of flights are charters/group bookings, please resist the urge to check in online. <strong>You MUST check in at the departure desk in the airport.</strong></p><p>All sorts of crazy stuff could happen if you try to check in beforehand (like everyone else losing their seats), so please don't! The same goes for upgrading. While you jet off to Stockholm with a glass of fizz in hand, the rest of your group booking could be stuck at home with unexpectedly cancelled tickets…</p><h3>TRAVELLING TO AND FROM THE VENUE</h3><p>We’ll be running morning buses to Stockholmsmässan on Thursday and Friday for visitors to the city. A departure schedule will be available at the venue, hotels and on the ‘My Shuttle Times’ Portal tab, so you have no excuse for missing your bus!</p><p>Shuttle buses will also be running back to three main stops in town on Thursday and Friday evenings: Hilton Slussen, Sheraton Stockholm and Elite Hotel Adlon (see 'My Shuttle Times' for more info). These are open to all attendees, whether visiting or based in Stockholm.</p><p>Stockholm-based Kingsters will need to get themselves to the venue in the mornings, just as they would on a ‘normal’ work day. You can find it at the following address, just a 10-minute commuter train ride from Central Station:</p><h4>Stockholmsmässan, Mässvägen 1, 125 30 Älvsjö</h4><p>If you’re coming by road, take the E4/E20 and follow the signs for Mässan/Älvsjö. Car parking is available at the venue – no pre-booking required, but you’ll need to collect a pre-paid ticket from the “Travel Desk” before leaving.</p><p>Please note that taxis to or from the venue on Thursday or Friday cannot be expensed. However, cabs will be provided for Stockholmers only after the Friday night party – just head to the “Taxi Stand” outside the main entrance to collect your voucher.</p><h3>GETTING AROUND THE CITY</h3><p>The public transport system in Stockholm is extensive and pretty reliable. Many people travel by boat, light railway and tram, but the metro and bus routes are most popular.</p><p><strong>METRO:</strong> Also known as the Tunnelbana or T-bana (look out for the big, blue ’T’ signs), this is the easiest way to get about. Tickets can be purchased from machines and kiosks inside the stations. Fun fact: The Stockholm metro is often referred to as “the world’s longest art gallery”, with most of its 100 stations housing sculptures, mosaics, installations and more. Check it out!</p><p><strong>BUS:</strong> A great way of seeing the city from above ground, buses are boarded with a single-use travelcard or zone ticket. You’ll need to get one of these from a metro or train station as you can’t buy a ticket once on board. Swedes drive on the right - remember this when deciding which side of the road to stand on!</p><h3>BUYING TICKETS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORT</h3><p>There are two types of ticket geared towards short-term visitors to Stockholm:</p><p><strong>Zone tickets:</strong> Perfect for occasional journeys as they must be used within a certain time frame. You can purchase a ticket for one, two or all of the city’s three zones:</p><ul><li><strong>1 zone:</strong> 36 SEK (valid for 75 minutes)</li><li><strong>2 zones:</strong> 54 SEK (valid for 75 minutes)</li><li><strong>3 zones:</strong> 72 SEK (valid for 120 minutes)</li></ul><p><strong>Single use travelcards:</strong> These give you access to all modes of public transport. They can be transferred between travellers, but only used by one at a time. There are two types of travelcard available:</p><ul><li><strong>24 hour:</strong> 115 SEK</li><li><strong>72 hour:</strong> 230 SEK</li></ul><p>If in doubt about what ticket you need, just ask in one of the station kiosks.</p><h3>TAXIS</h3><p>If you prefer to travel by cab, please be aware that taxi prices aren’t regulated in Sweden and can vary greatly. Prices are displayed on the rear side windows and dashboard, so check them out before you jump in! Most cabs take credit card, but worth checking that too.</p><p>There are numerous taxi companies in Stockholm, with our top recommendation being:</p><ul><li><strong>Taxi Stockholm:</strong> +46 8 15 00 00</li></ul><p>It’s advisable to book by ‘phone, but you can hail any cab with its light on. Other decent services include:</p><ul><li><strong>Taxi 020:</strong> +46 20 20 20 20</li><li><strong>Taxi Kurir:</strong> +46 8 30 00 00</li></ul></div>
