                        <p>Before starting to sign up for sessions please read the below so you understand how the day
                            is structured and what we need you to do!</p>

                        <p>All King activities, as part of the KingfoMarket Day, are pre-populated in your grid on the portal, except for the ‘Session’ activity which you need to register for. These will then also appear in your grid view. We encourage you to attend as many sessions as you can!</p>

                        <h3>Good to know:</h3>

                        <p><strong>Sessions capacity is limited, so it works on a first come first served
                            basis!</strong><br/>
                            If a session is full by the time you decide to attend it, you will be placed in an automated
                            queue and be notified by email when a seat becomes available.<br/>
                            If there is a clash with another session, you will get an email giving you a short period of
                            time to manage your sessions - either accept the space or decline it<br/>
                            If no action is taken to accept or decline the space within the time period the next
                            attendee in queue will be offered the seat.</p>
